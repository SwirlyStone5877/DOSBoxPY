# DOSBoxPY
A simple UI for DOSBox written in python because I suck at C.

## Installation
1. This requires DOSBox to be installed, of course. If you don't, you can find instructions [here](https://www.dosbox.com/wiki/Basic_Setup_and_Installation_of_DosBox "Instructions on how to set DOSBox up.").
2. Download either [the .py file](https://github.com/SwirlyStone5877/DOSBoxPY#the-py-file) or [the .exe file](https://github.com/SwirlyStone5877/DOSBoxPY#the-exe-file).
   ### The .py File
   a. Requires either Visual Studio Code (not recommended[^2]) or Python (the latest version)
     ##### Visual Studio Code
     a. Open the file with Visual Studio Code (if it doesn't ask automatically, right click the file and click "Open With.")
   
     b. Right click the file in Visual Studio Code.
   
     c. Click "Run in Interactive Window."
   
     d. Enjoy if it works!
     ##### Python
     a. Open the file.
   
     b. Done.
   ### The .exe File
   a. Click the file.
   b. Done.
## Usage
This relies on a command prompt to work. It uses the keyboard, and not the mouse. It uses numbers. The options include starting DOSBox, changing the settings, opening the (default) path to screenshots and recordings, and a simple about section.

## Contributions
If you'd like to team up with me, I'm open to contributions, but I won't be active at times. For a long time? For a short time? Who knows? It's random.

## Info
It's a work in progress, so it isn't done yet. But you can see the updated progress here (if I remember).
- [x] Code main menu
- [x] Code settings menu
- [ ] Code about section
- [ ] Make it suitable for command prompt
- [ ] pain
- [ ] Figure out how to compile python code
- [ ] Compile
- [ ] Get some test users
- [ ] Release

[^2]: Not recommended because the code was made for a command prompt, and not Visual Studio Code.
